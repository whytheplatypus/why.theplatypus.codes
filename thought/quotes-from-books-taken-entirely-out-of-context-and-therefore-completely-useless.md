### <u>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (Harold Abelson, Gerald Jay Sussman, Julie Sussman)</u>

> you must read and write computer programs---many of them. It doesn't matter much what the programs are about or what applications they serve. <cite>(p. xi)</cite>

<!-- -->

> Thus, programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. <cite>(p. xv)</cite>

<!-- -->

> They should feel secure about modifying a program, retaining the spirit and style of the original author. <cite>(p. xvi)</cite>

<!-- -->

> "computer science" is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers. <cite>(p. xvi)</cite>

<!-- -->

> Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to". <cite>(p. xvi)</cite>

<!-- -->

> In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells. <cite>(p. 1)</cite>

<!-- -->

> [A master software engineer] can visualize the behavior of his system in advance. <cite>(p. 2)</cite>

<!-- -->

> The user should not need to know how the procedure is implemented in order to use it. <cite>(p. 25)</cite>



### The Elements Of Programming Style (Kernigan and Plauger)

> Looking back on some of our own examples makes us realize how demanding an effort good programming is. <cite>(p. ix)</cite>

<!-- -->

> The way to learn to program well is by seeing, over and over, how real programs can be improved by the application of a few principles of good practice and a little common sense. Practice in critical reading leads to skill in rewriting, which in turn leads to better writing. <cite>(p. xi)</cite>

<!-- -->

> The principles of style, however, are applicable in all languages, including assembly codes. <cite>(p. xi)</cite>

<!-- -->

> Besides, there is the added danger that a too clever program may not say what you thought it said. <cite>(p. 2)</cite>

<!-- -->

> The trouble is, although any single weakness causes no great harm, the cumulative effect of several confusing statements is code that is simply unintelligible. <cite>(p. 3)</cite>

<!-- -->

> As much as possible, a program should be written so the control flow structures lead the reader quickly and directly to an understanding of what the program does. <cite>(p. 35)</cite>
