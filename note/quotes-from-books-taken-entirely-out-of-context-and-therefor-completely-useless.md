<br/>

> They should feel secure about modifying a program, retaining the spirit and style of the original author. (p. xvi)

<br/>

> "computer science" is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers. (p. xvi)

<br/>

> Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of "how to". (p. xvi)

<br/>

> In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells. (p. 1)

<br/>

> [A master software engineer] can visualize the behavior of his system in advance. (p. 2)

<br/>

> The user should not need to know how the procedure is implemented in order to use it. (p. 25)
